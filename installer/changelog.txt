2007.10.23 (k3b)
- Bugfix: MyMeta.Plugins.Xsd3b.dll was not added to installer and therefore not available in MyGenerateion
- Bugfix in xsd3b provider: Foreignkeys had only parent-child relation. Added child-parent relations
- Added support for uml1.3 import from "Enterprise Architect 2.5"

2007.10.21 - MyGeneration 1.3 beta 2
- Added MyGeneration Intellesense features. Ctrl-Space, autocomplete on ".", and calltip on "(" for methods work for the intrinsic objects. There is a lot of potential here for the future. This is just something I've implemented in C# and JScript to learn how scintilla works in this area.

2007.10.19 - MyGeneration 1.3 beta 1
- Upgraded DockPanel Suite
- Upgraded to my own custom branch of the Scintilla.Net project
- Complete rewrite of MDI Interface forms.
- Moved current controls/forms to seperate assembly so that they can e used in IDE plugins if needed
- Added a new Errors form that tracks application & template errors/exceptions. It can be saved to disk, emailed or cleared.
- Added a new console form that tracks activity in the application. It can be saved to disk or cleared.
- Using new toolbars and menus from 2.0. 
- Added toolbar merging for document type dockable windows.
- Added 3 types of plugins:
	- Document plugin: This allows the plugin author to tie into our file menu and toolbars and open specified file type into a custom dockable document window.
	- Content plugin: Allows a dockable window like a control bar or file browser that is not an editable/savable document, but provides some useful content/functionality to the user. The MyMeta browser and template broswer are good examples.
	- Simple Execute plugin: This is a menu item/toolbar icon plugin that executes some code in the plugin. It doesn't tie into the dockpanel suite, but could potentially launch a modal window.
- Added queries to proc-parameter descriptions in MyMeta for SQL Server.
- Fixed a couple Postgresql MyMeta performance issues thanks to Michael McKean
- Added ability to execute SQL in the current active document by clicking on the execute button in the MyMeta browser.
- Error handling is more controlled now. We can more accurately determine if an error happened within a template or the application.
- Xsd3b Plugin fixes/enhancements by k3b
	- Bugfiexs xsd export with numeric(10,2) adn function as default-value
	- Added more errorhandling with unique-constraints
