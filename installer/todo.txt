TODO: (by Priority)

komma8.komma1:
Tasks:
- Improve Project File support. Look at suggestions in enhancement list online/email.
- Execution of projects to console instead of that modal popup? 
- Add Sample plugins of each type. Zip them up and put them on sourceforge. SqlTool for document(done), CodeSmith for simple(done), new template library for conent(not yet started)
- Keyboard shortcut to iterate through open template documents. CTRL+TAB is the standard in Windows environments but right now CTRL+TAB and CTRL-PGUP/PGDN do the same thing -- iterate trough the tabs of the current template document;
- Keyboard shortcut to jump to the declaration or definition of an item;
- Brace matching;
- Code collapse/expand feature (tree-like structure in the editor with +/- signs next to collapsible code);
- Keyboard shortcuts for code collapse/expand feature;
- Enhanced Intellisense-like feature that shows method overloads and their signatures;
- Keyboard shortcut for inserting predefined code snippets;
- operation Completed message after project regen.
- There is going to need to be some serious testing before we have a stable application again. I will start building test fixtures soon.

- Test in Windows Vista/Windows 7.
- Full Application Wide Test. Build test suite?
